# You are tasked with building a simple deployed web application that allows users to create and manage their accounts, send and receive payments, and view transaction history. 
## The application should be built using React with Next.js (or similar frameworks) on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend.
### Firestore/Supabase (for simplicity or another DB of your choice) will be used as the database, and the application should be deployed using Vercel/Render/Heroku/AWS/GCP etc.
##### It should be live and viewable and have CI/CD.
